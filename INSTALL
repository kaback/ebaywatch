First of all, to make use of this you need an ebay API developer key. Go and get one from Ebay. Its free.

Read http://www.linux-magazin.de/Ausgaben/2004/01/E-Baywatcher/ for some background informations about what this is and what it is doing.

Make shure the following perl modules are available:

Config::Simple
Net::Jabber
DB_File
Log::Log4perl
eBay::API::Simple::Finding

copy .ebaywatchrc.sample into your homedir, rename it to .ebaywatchrc and edit informations about your jabber account and your ebay developer key.

copy .ebaysearch.sample into your homedir, rename it to .ebaysearch and set the path to this file inside of .ebaywatchrc

put some search terms into your .ebaysearch, line by line.

Have fun.
